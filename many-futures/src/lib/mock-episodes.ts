## Cold Open

Something strange is happening in consulting right now. IBM just published research showing 86% of buyers actively seeking AI-enabled advisory services. But 89% just assume consultancies will use AI anyway. That three percent gap keeps nagging at me.

Companies have ChatGPT licenses. They've run pilots. [McKinsey reports](https://mckinsey.com/ai-adoption) employees are using AI three times more than executives realize. Yet demand for AI consulting is growing, not shrinking. The UK consulting market grew 11% last year, mostly from AI and digital transformation work.

Makes you wonder what clients are actually buying.

## 📊 Signal: The Expectation Shift

94% of consultants believe client demand for AI services will increase this year according to [Accenture's Q2 2025 report](https://accenture.com/consulting-trends). Standard industry optimism, except for one detail: 66% of consulting buyers say they'll stop working with firms that don't incorporate AI into their services. Not firms that don't offer AI consulting. Firms that don't use AI themselves, internally, for their own work.

The baseline has shifted. Having AI isn't a differentiator anymore. It's like having email. Table stakes.

[PwC's research](https://pwc.com/ai-operations) calls this "AI intrinsic to operations." Half of tech leaders say AI is already fully integrated into their core business strategy. A third say it's fully integrated into products and services. We've moved past experimentation into expectation.

## 🔄 Connection: The Travel Agency Echo

Travel agencies faced something similar with online booking platforms. When Expedia launched, the assumption was simple: Why pay an agent when you can book directly? Agencies that survived did something unexpected. They stopped competing on access to inventory and started competing on curation.

Today [Virtuoso](https://virtuoso.com) has 20,000 luxury travel advisors doing $30 billion in sales. They call themselves "travel designers" now. Not travel agents. The distinction matters. They're not selling access to flights and hotels. They're selling navigation through overwhelming choice.

Consulting might be following a similar arc. When everyone has access to the same AI tools, access stops mattering. Navigation starts mattering more.

## 🧠 Pattern: The Sophistication Gap

[Gartner reports](https://gartner.com/ai-failures) a 30% failure rate for AI proof-of-concept projects. These aren't small companies with limited resources. These are enterprises with budgets, talent, and direct access to frontier models. The failures aren't technical. They're translational.

Only 25% of executives strongly believe their IT infrastructure can handle enterprise-wide AI deployment. 46% cite talent shortages as the main barrier to AI progress. But what talent exactly? Companies aren't struggling to hire AI engineers. They're struggling to find people who understand both AI capabilities and business operations.

The pattern suggests a specific type of confusion. Not "how does AI work?" but "where does AI fit?" Demand for ethical AI and bias mitigation services jumped 55% this year. Interest in explainable AI rose 37%. These aren't requests for implementation. They're requests for judgment.

## 💡 Possibility: The Navigation Economy

What if the real value isn't in having AI but in knowing what not to do with it?

92% of executives expect to boost AI spending over the next three years according to [Deloitte's Tech Trends](https://deloitte.com/tech-trends-2025). 87% expect revenue growth from generative AI in that timeframe. About half expect at least 5% revenue increase. Those expectations create pressure to adopt AI everywhere, for everything.

But universal adoption might be exactly wrong. Some processes need human judgment. Some regulations require human oversight. Some customer interactions benefit from human connection. Knowing where AI doesn't belong could matter more than knowing where it does.

Consultancies that help clients identify where NOT to use AI might find unexpected demand. Call it strategic restraint. Or AI portfolio management. The framing doesn't matter as much as the capability.

## ❓ Question: The Infrastructure Problem

What happens when AI becomes invisible infrastructure?

GPS used to be a separate device. Now it's just there, embedded in everything. Nobody thinks about it. The same thing happened with databases, email, cloud computing. Essential technologies that became invisible.

If AI follows that path, "AI consulting" as a category might have three years. Maybe five. After that, it gets absorbed into broader business transformation, strategic planning, operational excellence. The firms that survive won't be selling AI expertise. They'll be selling something else that happens to involve AI.

## 🔥 Tension: Agents vs Organizations

99% of developers building enterprise AI are working on agents according to [IBM's 2025 outlook](https://ibm.com/ai-agents). IBM calls 2025 "the year of the agent." Agents can analyze data, predict trends, automate workflows. The technical capabilities keep expanding.

But agents create organizational problems that technology can't solve. Who's accountable when an agent makes a decision? How do you restructure work when agents handle routine tasks? What happens to middle management when AI handles coordination?

Financial services firms face particular challenges. They can't just deploy agents and iterate. Regulators require explainability, audit trails, bias monitoring. The technology might be ready but the organizational and regulatory frameworks aren't.

This tension between technical possibility and organizational reality creates space for navigation expertise. Not "how to build agents" but "how to live with agents."

## Research Planning

The signals around AI consulting keep pointing toward navigation and judgment rather than implementation. Next exploration could dig into:

- How are regulated industries approaching AI adoption differently than tech companies?
- What happens to consulting firms that don't adapt quickly enough?
- Where are the unexpected success stories from smaller firms?
- What patterns separate the 30% of failed POCs from successes?

The regulatory angle feels particularly rich for Sarah's consultancy given their financial services focus.`;

## Cold Open

I've been tracking something that's making me rethink everything about client-consultancy relationships in the AI era, and it's not what I expected.

Everyone's focused on how AI will change what consultancies do internally—faster research, automated tasks, improved efficiency. But I'm seeing signals that suggest the real transformation is happening on the client side. The question isn't "How will AI help consultancies work better?" It's "What do clients actually need from consultancies when they have AI tools themselves?"

The more I dig into this, the more I think we're witnessing a fundamental shift in why clients hire external expertise—and it's creating opportunities that most consultancies aren't even aware of yet.

## Executive Summary

**Three possibilities I'm exploring about client-consultancy relationships:**

- **The Navigation Partner Future:** Clients increasingly need help making sense of AI possibilities and navigating implementation decisions, not just executing predetermined solutions
- **The Collaboration Facilitation Future:** The most valuable consultancy skill becomes helping organizations manage human-AI partnerships effectively
- **The Reckoning Response Future:** As AI hype gives way to accountability, clients need partners who can deliver demonstrable business value from AI investments

## Section 1: The Signal I Can't Ignore

Here's what caught my attention: 86% of consulting buyers are now actively looking for advisory services that incorporate AI and technology assets according to [Accenture's Q2 2025 report](https://accenture.com/consulting-q2-2025). But here's the twist—89% simply expect that consulting services of any kind should incorporate AI for improved productivity and quality.

That gap between "actively looking for" and "simply expecting" tells a story. Clients aren't just shopping for AI expertise anymore; they're assuming it's table stakes. Which makes me wonder: what are they actually hiring consultancies for if AI capabilities are becoming the baseline expectation?

I'm seeing another pattern in procurement language. [Gartner's procurement analytics](https://gartner.com/procurement-2025) show demand for ethical AI and bias mitigation services has risen by 55%, while interest in explainable AI models has increased by 37%. That's not just technical requirement evolution—that suggests clients are grappling with AI governance challenges they can't solve internally.

> **The question that keeps surfacing:** If clients expect consultancies to use AI, but also need help navigating AI complexities, what does that mean for the traditional consulting value proposition?

## Section 2: The Reckoning Reality

There's something else happening that feels significant. 2025 is being called "AI's reckoning moment" by [McKinsey](https://mckinsey.com/ai-reckoning-2025) as clients' hope and hype of the last two years give way to expectation—AI products need to demonstrate they can move beyond industry playthings to valuable business tools.

This isn't just about AI vendors proving their worth. It's about clients becoming more sophisticated buyers who can distinguish between AI theater and AI value. And that sophistication is changing what they need from consultancies.

What I find fascinating is the contradiction emerging: clients expect AI to make services cheaper due to efficiency gains, but simultaneously demand higher value delivery. This creates productive tension. Clients want the cost benefits of AI automation, but they also want consultancies to solve problems that AI tools alone can't address.

That gap might be where new value propositions emerge.

## The Navigation Challenge

I keep encountering this theme: clients with AI tools don't necessarily know what to do with them. Having access to ChatGPT or Claude doesn't automatically translate to strategic AI implementation in financial services with regulatory constraints.

What if the most valuable consultancy capability becomes "AI decision navigation"—helping clients figure out which AI possibilities are worth pursuing, which regulatory risks to consider, and how to structure human-AI collaboration for their specific context?

This would flip the traditional consulting model. Instead of "We'll implement this solution for you," it becomes "We'll help you navigate the solution space and make better decisions about AI investments."

For Sarah's design consultancy, this could mean positioning as specialists in helping financial services firms design their AI adoption strategy, not just implementing AI-powered design solutions.

## Section 3: The Collaboration Complexity

Here's another pattern I'm tracking: the complexity of human-AI collaboration in regulated environments. Clients are looking for services that incorporate AI and technology assets, but financial services firms need to maintain human oversight for compliance reasons.

This creates a design challenge that's both technical and organizational. How do you create workflows where AI augments human creativity without compromising regulatory accountability? How do you design interfaces that make AI-human collaboration feel natural rather than awkward?

These aren't problems that AI tools solve automatically. They require understanding of both technology capabilities and organizational dynamics—exactly the kind of hybrid expertise that design consultancies could develop.

## What This Might Mean for Client Relationships

If I'm reading these signals correctly, client relationships might be evolving in several interesting directions:

**From Implementation to Investigation:** Clients might start hiring consultancies to help them investigate AI possibilities before committing to specific solutions. Less "build this" and more "help us figure out what's worth building."

**From Execution to Education:** As AI capabilities evolve quickly, clients might need ongoing education about new possibilities and risks. Design consultancies could become continuous learning partners rather than project-based solution providers.

**From Solutions to Systems Thinking:** In regulated environments, AI implementation isn't just about individual tools—it's about how those tools fit into compliance frameworks, risk management systems, and organizational culture.

Each of these shifts would require different capabilities and different client relationship models.

## The Questions Worth Exploring

- What if AI literacy becomes the real bottleneck? If clients have access to powerful AI tools but don't know how to use them strategically, consultancies that can bridge that knowledge gap might become more valuable, not less.

- What if regulatory navigation becomes the premium service? With 37% increase in interest in explainable AI models and rising demand for ethical AI services, understanding how to implement AI within regulatory constraints might be where the highest value lies.

- What if collaboration design becomes a distinct discipline? Designing effective human-AI partnerships might require entirely new approaches that combine UX design, organizational psychology, and technology implementation.

- What if clients start hiring consultancies to help them become better AI buyers? Instead of outsourcing AI implementation, clients might want help developing internal AI strategy and vendor evaluation capabilities.

## The Timing Question

What's particularly interesting about timing is how quickly client expectations seem to be shifting. [Deloitte reports](https://deloitte.com/consulting-evolution) 75% of consulting firms are expected to integrate AI into their workflows by 2025, which suggests this transition is happening fast.

But here's what I'm wondering: if client expectations are evolving faster than consultancy capabilities, there might be a window where firms that develop AI navigation and collaboration design expertise early could capture disproportionate value.

The risk is that this window might be shorter than traditional capability development cycles. By the time most consultancies build AI-enhanced capabilities, clients might already be looking for the next level of sophistication.

## Research Planning

This exploration has surfaced several research directions that feel worth pursuing:

**Client Decision-Making Patterns:** How are financial services firms actually making AI investment decisions? What information do they need that they can't get internally?

**Regulatory Implementation Reality:** What does AI compliance actually look like in practice? Where are firms struggling with the intersection of innovation and regulation?

**Human-AI Collaboration Design:** Are there emerging best practices for designing effective human-AI partnerships in creative work?

My instinct is that the regulatory implementation reality might be the most revealing. If firms are struggling with practical compliance challenges, that could create immediate opportunities for consultancies with relevant expertise.`;
