# Site Architecture Scratchpad (Backlog & Context)

Status: Draft | Last Updated: 2025-08-08

A lightweight place to track open items, priorities, and context while we iterate in `many-futures-prototype-v4/`.

---

## Backlog (near-term)
- Projects overview page (cards, signals, CTA)
- Project home (Episodes list + Upcoming preview)
- Project-level search (title/synopsis; future: block match)
- Account page (profile, org name “My Team”)
- Minimal notifications (episode published)

## Future (prepare architecture)
- Global projects (`isGlobal`, subscribe/follow, Substack syndication)
- Episode visibility override per episode
- Org switcher (multi-org)
- Public read-only episode view

## Notes
- No breadcrumbs; keep interface clean
- Clerk Organisations default + single-owner at launch
- Daily cadence; upcoming episode shows key questions
