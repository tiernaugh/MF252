# Many Futures Design Language

**Status:** Living Document  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-13  
**Purpose:** Maintain consistency across the product as we iterate  
**Recent Update:** Implemented unified design system (Option C) - editorial/functional hybrid

## Core Principles

### 1. Editorial Intelligence
Many Futures should feel like a premium publication, not a SaaS dashboard. We're creating a reading experience for strategic thinkers, not another analytics tool.

### 2. Quiet Confidence
The interface should get out of the way. No loud CTAs, no aggressive upsells, no notification badges competing for attention. The content is the hero.

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
Show what's needed, when it's needed. Don't overwhelm new users with features they won't use for weeks. Start simple, reveal complexity.

### 4. Respect for Time
Every interaction should feel worthwhile. If something takes 7 minutes to read, it should deliver 7 minutes of value. No padding, no fluff.

## Visual Language

### Color Philosophy
We use a **restrained palette** centered on stone tones with white as primary. Color is functional, not decorative.

```
Primary Palette:
- White:     Primary background (reading surfaces)
- Stone-50:  Secondary backgrounds (cards, sections)
- Stone-100: Tertiary backgrounds (hover states)
- Stone-200: Borders, dividers
- Stone-600: Body text
- Stone-700: Secondary text
- Stone-900: Headlines, primary text

Accent Colors (Sparingly):
- Green-500: Active status (projects running)
- Stone-300: Paused status (projects paused)
- Blue-600: Links, NEW badges
- Red-500: Errors (rare, we prevent rather than alert)
```

### Typography Hierarchy
**Unified serif/sans system** creates editorial feel while maintaining function.

```
Font Stack:
- Serif: Lora, Charter, Georgia (major headings, episode content)
- Sans: Inter, system-ui (UI text, metadata)

Headings (ALL use serif for consistency):
- H1: font-serif text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold (Hero titles, major pages)
- H2: font-serif text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold (Section headers, cards)
- H3: font-sans text-xl font-semibold (Subsections)
- H4: font-sans text-lg font-medium (Minor headings)

Body:
- Reading: font-serif text-lg leading-relaxed (Episode content only)
- UI Text: font-sans text-base (Descriptions, forms)
- Small: font-sans text-sm (Metadata)
- Micro: font-sans text-xs uppercase tracking-wider (Labels, badges)
```

### Spacing System
Generous whitespace creates premium feel. When in doubt, add more space.

```
Component Spacing:
- Cards: p-8 (Generous internal padding)
- Sections: space-y-6 or gap-8 (Clear separation)
- Inline: space-x-2 to space-x-4 (Comfortable but connected)
```

### Component Patterns

#### Cards
- White background on white canvas (unified)
- Defined border (border-stone-200)
- Hover: shadow-xl with noticeable lift (-translate-y-1)
- Transition: 300ms for smooth interactions
- Padding: p-8 for generous breathing room

#### Status Indicators
- Small colored dots, not badges (unless prominence needed)
- Position: top-right of cards
- Green = Active, Gray = Paused

#### Avatars
- Project initials in circles (2 letters max)
- Gradient background for active projects
- Flat gray for paused projects
- Size: w-12 h-12 for cards

## Interaction Patterns

### Navigation
- **Context-aware nav**: Full for lists, minimal for reading
- **Auto-hide on scroll**: Minimal nav hides when scrolling down
- **No sidebar**: Reduces complexity, maintains focus
- **Three modes**:
  1. Full Navigation (Projects, Dashboard)
  2. Minimal Navigation (Episodes, Project detail)
  3. Hybrid Navigation (Future long-form pages)

### Filtering & Search
- **Search first**: Prominent search before filters
- **Pill filters**: Rounded, toggle between states
- **Sort dropdown**: Simple select, not complex controls

### Feedback
- **Optimistic updates**: Update UI immediately
- **Subtle confirmations**: Brief success states
- **Inline errors**: Fix problems where they occur

### Loading States
- **Skeleton screens**: Show structure while loading
- **Progressive enhancement**: Show what's ready
- **No spinners**: Unless absolutely necessary

## Content Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
- **Clear, not clever**: Straightforward labels
- **Professional, not corporate**: Human but serious
- **Confident, not arrogant**: Know our value

### Microcopy Examples
```
Good:
- "Next episode: 20 Aug 2025"
- "3 projects ‚Ä¢ 2 active"
- "No projects found"

Avoid:
- "Your next awesome episode drops on..."
- "You have 3 amazing projects!"
- "Oops! Nothing here yet! üéâ"
```

### Empty States
- State the fact clearly
- Offer the next action
- No apologizing or excessive friendliness

## Motion & Animation

### Principles
- **Purposeful**: Motion should clarify, not decorate
- **Consistent**: 300ms transitions throughout
- **Natural**: Ease functions, not linear
- **Premium feel**: Slightly more lift on hover

### Common Animations
```css
/* Hover states (unified) */
transition: all 300ms ease;
transform: translateY(-4px); /* -translate-y-1 in Tailwind */
box-shadow: shadow-xl;

/* Navigation auto-hide */
transition: transform 300ms ease;
transform: translateY(-100%) when hidden;

/* Focus states */
transition: box-shadow 200ms ease;

/* Page transitions */
Instant navigation (no fade between pages)
```

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: Full width cards, stack everything
- **Tablet** (md): 2-column grids appear
- **Desktop** (lg): Full layout, optimal reading width

### Content Priority
1. Mobile: Only essential info in cards
2. Tablet: Add metadata
3. Desktop: Full experience with all details

## What We're NOT Doing

### Avoid These Patterns
- ‚ùå Dark mode (not MVP priority)
- ‚ùå Animated illustrations
- ‚ùå Gradient backgrounds
- ‚ùå Multiple font families
- ‚ùå Icon-heavy interfaces
- ‚ùå Notification dots/badges
- ‚ùå Slide-out panels
- ‚ùå Modal dialogs (prefer inline)
- ‚ùå Toast notifications (prefer inline)

### Design Debt to Address Later
- Enhanced mobile experience
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Advanced filtering
- Data visualizations
- Rich text formatting in episodes

## Component Inventory

### Current Components (Unified Design)
1. **Project Card**: Avatar, serif title (2xl), generous padding (p-8)
2. **Episode Reader**: Centered hero, serif titles (5-6xl), minimal nav
3. **Project Detail**: Editorial hero section, centered layout, serif headings
4. **Navigation**: Context-aware (full/minimal), auto-hide behavior
5. **Search Bar**: Icon, input, consistent borders (stone-200)
6. **Filter Pills**: Rounded, toggle states, clear active state
7. **Buttons**: Primary (stone-900), hover states (shadow-xl, -translate-y-1)

### Planned Components (Future)
- Payment forms
- Settings panels
- Admin dashboards
- Email templates

## Usage Examples

  <section className="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-8 py-16 text-center">
    <h1 className="font-serif text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold">
      {title}
    </h1>
  </section>
  
  {/* Zone 2: Functional Content */}
  <section className="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 py-8">
    {/* Your content */}
  </section>
</div>
```

### Creating a Card
```tsx
<Card className="bg-white border border-stone-200 hover:shadow-xl hover:-translate-y-1 transition-all duration-300">
  <CardContent className="p-8">
    {/* Serif title for editorial feel */}
    <h3 className="font-serif text-2xl font-semibold text-stone-900">
      {title}
    </h3>
    {/* Sans-serif for body text */}
    <p className="text-base text-stone-600">
      {description}
    </p>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

## Maintenance Notes

This document should evolve as we:
1. User test and get feedback
2. Add new features
3. Discover what resonates
4. Learn what confuses

Regular reviews: After each major feature or user feedback session.
