## üö´ What We're NOT Building

**Absolutely Not:**
- Chat interface (unless users demand it)
- Vector embeddings (expensive, unproven)
- Complex memory system (over-engineered)
- Multiple projects (one is enough initially)
- 8 block types (start with markdown)

**Build Only If Pulled:**
```typescript
if (users.filter(u => u.requested('chat')).length > 3) {
  FEATURES.CHAT = true;
}
```

## üìù Daily Standup Questions

Every morning at 9am:
1. **What shipped yesterday?**
2. **What are today's costs?**
3. **What did users say?**
4. **What ships today?**

---

## üîó Quick Commands

```bash
# Start development
cd many-futures && pnpm dev --filter=app

# Check costs
pnpm exec prisma studio
# Look at TokenUsage table

# Deploy to production
git push origin main
# Vercel auto-deploys

# Run episode generation manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/episodes/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"projectId": "..."}'

# Check analytics
# Visit: https://vercel.com/analytics
```

## üéØ The North Star

**Question to ask every day:**
> "Will this help us get 5 paying customers in 2 weeks?"

If no ‚Üí Don't build it.  
If maybe ‚Üí Defer it.  
If yes ‚Üí Ship it today.
