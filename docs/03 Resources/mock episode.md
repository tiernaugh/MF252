# When Everyone Has AI, What Are Consultancies Actually For?

## Cold Open

Something strange is happening in consulting right now. IBM just published research showing 86% of buyers actively seeking AI-enabled advisory services. But 89% just assume consultancies will use AI anyway. That three percent gap keeps nagging at me.

Companies have ChatGPT licenses. They've run pilots. McKinsey says employees are using AI three times more than executives realize. Yet demand for AI consulting is growing, not shrinking. The UK consulting market grew 11% last year, mostly from AI and digital transformation work.

Makes you wonder what clients are actually buying.

## üìä Signal: The Expectation Shift

94% of consultants believe client demand for AI services will increase this year. Standard industry optimism, except for one detail. 66% of consulting buyers say they'll stop working with firms that don't incorporate AI into their services. Not firms that don't offer AI consulting. Firms that don't use AI themselves, internally, for their own work.

The baseline has shifted. Having AI isn't a differentiator anymore. It's like having email. Table stakes.

PwC calls this "AI intrinsic to operations." Half of tech leaders say AI is already fully integrated into their core business strategy. A third say it's fully integrated into products and services. We've moved past experimentation into expectation.

## üîÑ Connection: The Travel Agency Echo

Travel agencies faced something similar with online booking platforms. When Expedia launched, the assumption was simple. Why pay an agent when you can book directly? Agencies that survived did something unexpected. They stopped competing on access to inventory and started competing on curation.

Today Virtuoso has 20,000 luxury travel advisors doing $30 billion in sales. They call themselves "travel designers" now. Not travel agents. The distinction matters. They're not selling access to flights and hotels. They're selling navigation through overwhelming choice.

Consulting might be following a similar arc. When everyone has access to the same AI tools, access stops mattering. Navigation starts mattering more.

## üß† Pattern: The Sophistication Gap

Gartner reports a 30% failure rate for AI proof-of-concept projects. These aren't small companies with limited resources. These are enterprises with budgets, talent, and direct access to frontier models. The failures aren't technical. They're translational.

Only 25% of executives strongly believe their IT infrastructure can handle enterprise-wide AI deployment. 46% cite talent shortages as the main barrier to AI progress. But what talent exactly? Companies aren't struggling to hire AI engineers. They're struggling to find people who understand both AI capabilities and business operations.

The pattern suggests a specific type of confusion. Not "how does AI work?" but "where does AI fit?" Demand for ethical AI and bias mitigation services jumped 55% this year. Interest in explainable AI rose 37%. These aren't requests for implementation. They're requests for judgment.

## üí° Possibility: The Navigation Economy

What if the real value isn't in having AI but in knowing what not to do with it?

92% of executives expect to boost AI spending over the next three years. 87% expect revenue growth from generative AI in that timeframe. About half expect at least 5% revenue increase. Those expectations create pressure to adopt AI everywhere, for everything.

But universal adoption might be exactly wrong. Some processes need human judgment. Some regulations require human oversight. Some customer interactions benefit from human connection. Knowing where AI doesn't belong could matter more than knowing where it does.

Consultancies that help clients identify where NOT to use AI might find unexpected demand. Call it strategic restraint. Or AI portfolio management. The framing doesn't matter as much as the capability.

## ‚ùì Question: The Infrastructure Problem

What happens when AI becomes invisible infrastructure? 

GPS used to be a separate device. Now it's just there, embedded in everything. Nobody thinks about it. The same thing happened with databases, email, cloud computing. Essential technologies that became invisible.

If AI follows that path, "AI consulting" as a category might have three years. Maybe five. After that, it gets absorbed into broader business transformation, strategic planning, operational excellence. The firms that survive won't be selling AI expertise. They'll be selling something else that happens to involve AI.

## üî• Tension: Agents vs Organizations

99% of developers building enterprise AI are working on agents. IBM calls 2025 "the year of the agent." Agents can analyze data, predict trends, automate workflows. The technical capabilities keep expanding.

But agents create organizational problems that technology can't solve. Who's accountable when an agent makes a decision? How do you restructure work when agents handle routine tasks? What happens to middle management when AI handles coordination?

Financial services firms face particular challenges. They can't just deploy agents and iterate. Regulators require explainability, audit trails, bias monitoring. The technology might be ready but the organizational and regulatory frameworks aren't.

This tension between technical possibility and organizational reality creates space for navigation expertise. Not "how to build agents" but "how to live with agents."

## ‚ö° Timing: The Window

Xavier AI launched as the world's first fully AI strategy consultant. Their pitch is simple. "99.9% of businesses could never afford McKinsey." True. But those businesses also can't afford to get AI strategy wrong.

The timing creates an interesting dynamic. Early movers in AI consulting are establishing relationships now that could last through the transformation period. Late entrants will find the basic AI consulting space already commoditized.

Three to five years feels like the window. Long enough to build expertise and relationships. Short enough that the market won't completely transform before you can capture value. After that, AI consulting becomes something else. Maybe it gets absorbed into broader transformation work. Maybe it evolves into something we can't predict yet.

## üé≠ Speculative: The Reverse Consulting Model

Here's a wild possibility. What if clients start hiring consultancies to train their AI systems rather than implement them?

Companies are sitting on decades of institutional knowledge. Process documentation, decision histories, strategy documents. That's training data for AI systems, but it needs curation, cleaning, structuring. Consultancies understand business processes and could help companies turn institutional knowledge into AI capabilities.

Instead of consultancies using AI to serve clients, clients might hire consultancies to make their AI more capable. The relationship inverts. Consultancies become AI trainers rather than AI users.

Probably too speculative. But the idea of consultancies as knowledge refiners rather than knowledge providers feels directionally interesting.

## Research Planning

The signals around AI consulting keep pointing toward navigation and judgment rather than implementation. Next exploration could dig into specific patterns:

How are regulated industries approaching AI adoption differently than tech companies? The compliance requirements might reveal what kinds of expertise actually matter.

What happens to consulting firms that don't adapt quickly enough? There might be early indicators in firm restructuring, talent movements, or client defections.

Where are the unexpected success stories? Smaller firms or non-traditional players who found angles the big consultancies missed.

The 30% failure rate on proof-of-concepts feels worth deeper investigation. What patterns separate failures from successes? Technical issues, organizational readiness, or something else?
